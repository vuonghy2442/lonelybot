# The theorem farm - formalized

The statement layer for the results beyond the kernel: the
reversibility/commitment structure (their Lemma A1), the structural
acyclicity of the matching (the forest potential), and the deck
integration.  The relabeling group lives in `Klondike.Relabel` and the
commutation schema in `Klondike.Commutation`; this module re-exports both,
so downstream importers see the union unchanged.

`pilePile` is an involution; `draw` is cyclically invertible;
`pileStack`∘`stackPile` is a *near*-inverse — the anchor case (a
fully-revealed non-king bottom card cannot return to the empty pile)
is exactly why safe-stacking (C1) is a theorem in the engine rather
than trivia, and where the reshape lemma (B4) earns its keep.

cursor 0, dealing everything (the clamp passes the last card) and
wrapping lands home — the deal cycle's period is `⌈n/s⌉ + 1`, at any
step `s ≥ 1` (deck.rs `offset`'s periodicity).  Supersedes the old

/-- The stack half of the accommodation step — the isolated B4 reshape
crux (this file's only `sorry`): a legal `pileStack` never hurts
solvability.  Together with `solvable_of_stackPile` this is the whole
content of the hard direction; the play-level lifting below is proved.
TODO(proof) [H].  PLAN (verify, don't trust; the wave-8 sketch stands,
with one correction — the worry-back half is DONE above):

Induct on the winning play π from `st`, splitting on π's first move.
* `pileStack c` itself — delete it: `s₁` runs π's tail directly.
* Moves commuting with the `c`-difference — replay and induct: no move
  of π can seat at `c`'s base `b` while `c` occupies it, and the
  blindness kit covers the components `c` does not touch.
* Moves seating ON `c` (`deckPile`/`stackPile`/`pilePile` x `(inr c)`)
  — the park.  KEY STRUCTURE (the catch-22 that makes the reshape
  work): every park is transient — `c`'s suit must pass rung
  `toIdx c` before winning, the rung card is `c` itself, and a stacked
  `c` admits no tenant, so the parked `x` leaves before the rung
  passes; `x`'s exit is its own `pileStack` (rung-gated but
  `c`-suit-independent — fires equally from `s₁`) or a reseat on a
  rank-mate; delay the rung past the park and the delete-strategy
  applies from the other side.
* `stackPile` of `c`'s suit at the shifted rung `toIdx c - 1` — the
  excursion pair (net identity): replay at the shifted height.
  (`deckStack` of a phantom stock copy of `c` is excluded by
  `vis_off_cycle`.)

The endgame is the return-base crux: when `c`'s base was
deal-adjacent, `canReturnBase` fails and the worry-back lands on a
rank-mate instead — the Dominance ledger's N-half, the same root.  The
returnable half needs `pileStack_stackPile_roundtrip` plus the guard
bundle, whose visibility piece (`vis_base_of_notLocked`) currently
lives downstream in Dominance — lift it here first (re-proving
`bottomOf_detach_self` from Bridge on the way). -/

STATEMENT REPAIRED (2026-09-13): as staged (no WF hypothesis) it was
FALSE — prover-confirmed witness `Temp/opencode/B4Witness.lean`
(axiom-clean facts): a WON state with a *phantom tenant* (♠2 seated on
base `inr ♠K` while ♠K is unplaced — exactly what WF's `board_edges`
forbids) and junk occupying every anchor but p0; the accommodation
`[stackPile ♠K p0]` seats the king under its tenant, and the successor
is a total deadlock (only `draw` fires, as the identity) — ♠K can never
re-stack, so it is unsolvable while the source is already won.  Repair:
add `(hwf : st.WF)` — the design docs' invariant, preserved by the
accommodation moves themselves (`apply_wf`).  No downstream users of
the old statement existed.

The proof decomposes over the accommodation play (each move is a
`pileStack` or a `stackPile`): each step preserves WF (`apply_wf`) and
solvability (`solvable_of_accomm_step`), and the induction carries
the winning play through the shuffle. -/

/-! ## 4. Structure — the matching is a forest

STATEMENT REPAIR (2026-09-13, prover-confirmed witness
`Temp\opencode\AboveIrreflWitness.lean`, axiom-clean): the staged
grading — everything above a card is strictly lower rank, hence
acyclicity, from `WF` alone — is FALSE.  `board_edges` admits
deal-adjacency edges, and the deal stacks arbitrarily, so a
deal-adjacency edge can invert a `canSitOn` edge between the same two
cards.  Witness: pile p1 dealt `[♥5, ♠6]` fully revealed, board
`inr ♥5 ↦ ♠6` (deal-adjacency, base visible) and `inr ♠6 ↦ ♥5`
(`canSitOn ♥5 ♠6`: 5+1=6, colors differ) — the state is WF, and
`aboveOf ♥5 = [♥5, ♠6]` contains `♥5`.  Longer alternating cycles
(deal-adjacency and canSitOn edges alternating across two piles, e.g.
`♥5 ↦ ♦9 ↦ ♣8 ↦ ♠6 ↦ ♥5` with the first and third edges deal-adjacent)
defeat every per-edge or global-deal-order repair: the acyclicity is
genuinely historical (which edge was attached last), not a state-only
consequence of the edge predicates.

The defensible acyclicity — the original design intent — is the
*forest potential*: a strictly decreasing measure along the matching's
card-edges.  Every play from `State.initial` maintains one (the deal's
own chains grade by within-pile position; every attach renumbers the
moved tree below its new base — the self-landing guard makes the trees
disjoint; reveal shifts the boundary into the gap) — that
play-induction is a later wave's item; here the potential is the
hypothesis, and the grading + acyclicity follow from it.

card-to-card edge of the matching (`topOf (inr c) = some y` — `y` sits

/-! ## 5. The deck integration — the jump IS the physical game

The Draw commitments (`applyDrawTo`, `applyDrawStackTo`) are the
derived jumps; these are the statements that the guard makes them
exactly the physical game: jump-then-play ≡ deal-until-then-play.
C9's premise, as theorems, at every draw step (at step 1 the guard is
trivial — `reachablePos_step1`).  The bridge to `toEngine_simulates`
consumes these. -/

/-! ### The deal-iteration kit — the jump-soundness machinery

`Cycle.dealIter` is `k` deals (Macro.lean's `Cycle.dealN` restated —
this file cannot import Macro), with the orbit correspondence: → every
accessible position is dealt to (`dealReach_maskPos`), ← every cursor
the chain reaches lands in the original mask (`dealIter_orbit` +
`dealIter_mask`), which with `stock_wf`'s duplicate-freeness pins the
position. -/

/-- A full pass plus the wrap deal returns to the pass start: from
cursor 0, dealing everything (the clamp passes the last card) and
wrapping lands home — the deal cycle's period is `⌈n/s⌉ + 1`, at any
step `s ≥ 1` (deck.rs `offset`'s periodicity).  Supersedes the old
rotate-form "a full rotation is the identity", an artifact of the
jump semantics.

Route: `run_dealIter` unpacks the play; `q = (n+s-1)/s` is exactly
`⌈n/s⌉` (`q·s ≥ n` and `d·s ≥ n → d ≥ q`, both from
`Nat.div_add_mod` + `Nat.mod_lt`), so `d ≤ q` deals from cursor 0 stay
on the first pass at `min (d·s, n)` (the induction's step needs
`d·s < n`, i.e. minimality), the `q`-th deal clamps at `n`, and the
wrap deal returns to `0` — the stock, and with it the state, is
unchanged. -/

false, so no `deckPile` ever reaches the successor).  With the guard:
